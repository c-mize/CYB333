- Shows PASS/FAIL result for each control

Requirements & Dependencies:
- Requires macOS operating system
- Requires Python version 3.9+

Tool Set-up/running:
- Ensure Python is installed by running "python3 --version"
- Download the "CYB333 Project.py" file and run it within the terminal using the command "python 3 CYB333 project.py".
